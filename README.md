# Womens_Safety_App
By the survey of Delhi governmentâ€™s Women and Child Development Department, 
around 80% of the women in national capital have fear regarding their safety. Women are harassed not only in the night or evening but also in the day time at their 
home, working places, or other places like street, club, etc

Here, I introduce an android app that ensures the safety of women.
It reduces the 
risk and helps us in need by identifying the location of person who is in danger.
The key features of our app that makes it different from others apps are as follows:

i. Initially, we have to enter the five contact numbers of police, family members 
and friends in to the application.

ii. While travelling, run the application and shake the phone.

iii. As soon as phone is Shaked, it sends the message containing location URL of the victim to all the contact numbers.

iv. It can also make calls manually to the emergency contacts(police, ambulance, etc) from the mobile phones when the women face an uncomfortable situation.

v. It also plays siren by just clicking on button so to make nearby people alert.
